      Used data from Kaggle (Machine Learning Group - ULB : https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
## Data Description
      •	This dataset contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. 
      •	Features V1, V2, … V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. 
      •	Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.




•	Implemented different algorithms like Logistic Regression, Support Vector machines, K-nearest Neighbor and Random Forest to detect the frauds

• Achieved the Recall score of 0.96 with Logistic Regression.
